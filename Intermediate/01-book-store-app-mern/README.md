# Book Store MERN app

This project is a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack application that serves as a simple book management system. It includes a backend implemented with Express.js and MongoDB for storing book data, and a front-end built using React.js and Vite.js for displaying and managing the books. The project demonstrates CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for books, and the components are structured in a modular way for better code organization.

# Technologies Used

# Backend (Node.js and Express.js)

1. Express.js: The backend server is built using Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Express.js is used for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.

2. MongoDB: The project integrates with MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and retrieve book data. Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, is used to define the book schema and interact with the database.

# Frontend (React.js and Vite.js)

1. React.js: The front-end is developed using React.js, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React components are used for modularizing the application, and React Router is employed for navigation between different pages.

2. Vite.js: Vite.js is the build tool used for the front-end. It offers fast development and optimized builds, making the development process efficient.

3. Tailwind CSS: Styling is done using Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS classes are applied for a clean and responsive design.

# Functionality

The key features of the Book Store include:

1. Books CRUD Operations: The application allows users to perform CRUD operations on books, including adding new books, viewing book details, editing book information, and deleting books.

2. Different Display Modes: Users can switch between different display modes (table and card) for viewing the list of books.
